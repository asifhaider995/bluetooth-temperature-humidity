# bluetooth-temperature-humidity
This repository for the project of the course (code: CSE323) Operating Systems, taken by Dr. Nova Ahmed.

~ Components used to build the module -

-> Arduino NANO R3
-> DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
-> HC-05 Bluetooth Module
-> Power Source: 3.7V Li-ion battery

A DHT Arduino library is used to instantiate a DHT22 sensor, get readings from it. The Bluetooth
module is used to connect to a phone. 

Using 'HC-05 Bluetooth Terminal' Android app the bluetooth data is taken and printed on the 
smartphone interface.
